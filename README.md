I discovered programming in the last year of my technical gymnasium. 
I learned how to write code on an Arduino Uno, which ended in me ACCIDENTALLY creating a closed-loop feedback system for my school project. Ever since that moment, I knew I was destined to become an engineer.
Since then, I have been enjoying learning and creating code for embedded systems, apps, and simulations. 

I have worked with C/C++, .NET, Python, and Matlab & Simulink.

I am currently working on multiple projects: Arduino library for ADXL372 accelerometer, and a Python App that generates a detailed report of your electricity consumption
